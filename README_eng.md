Radio Spot Watcher ‚Äî v2.84 stable

Radio Spot Watcher is a real-time dashboard for amateur radio operators.

It connects to a DX cluster (telnet), parses live spots, displays active calls with band / mode / DXCC info, shows rare DX targets, and builds quick stats.

The goal:

- See who‚Äôs on the air right now.
- Spot rare DXCC entities in seconds.
- Highlight stations you personally care about.
- Watch band activity trends at a glance.

This README documents version v2.84 "stable".

‚ú® Key Features

1. DX Cluster Connection

- Automatic telnet connection to a DX cluster (default: dxfun.com:8000).
- Auto-reconnect if the session drops.
- Connection status indicator:
   - Green = connected
   - Red = offline
- Active cluster host/port is shown in the header.

2. Live Spots Table

- Incoming spots are shown immediately.
- Typical columns:
   - UTC time
   - Frequency
   - Call (spotted callsign)
   - Mode (SSB / CW / FT8 / etc.)
   - Band (20m / 6m / 2m / QO-100 / etc.)
   - DXCC (country / entity)
   - Grid (locator if provided)
   - Spotter (who reported the spot)
- Newest spots appear at the top.
- Callsigns are clickable (QRZ lookups).
- If a call is in your watchlist, that row is visually highlighted.

3. Band / Mode Filters

- Dropdown "Band": All / 160m / 80m / ... / 6m / 2m / 70cm / QO-100.
- Dropdown "Mode": All / SSB / CW / FT8 / etc.
- Filters apply instantly to the spot table without a full reload.

4. Watchlist (calls under surveillance)

- You can add callsigns you want to watch.
- The watchlist is rendered in the header UI as badges.
- Each badge shows a trash icon to remove that callsign.
- When a watched callsign appears in the live spot stream:
   - Its row gets a strong visual highlight.
   - You can‚Äôt miss it.

(Older popup-style input is being phased out in favor of inline entry.)

5. Most Wanted DXCC

- Displays a curated list of the most wanted DXCC entities / rare islands.
- Two-column layout of "cards".
- The plan is to display:
   - Entity name,
   - DXCC / reference,
   - A small flag or island identifier icon.
- Purpose: instantly know if something from the "top wanted" list just showed up.

6. Map View

- Leaflet map shows recent spots.
- Each spot is plotted using approximate coordinates (DXCC country position, grid locator, etc.).
- Marker color depends on band (e.g. 20m / 40m / 6m get different colors).
- The map panel can be vertically resized / arranged with the stats panel.

7. Live Stats

- Quick bar charts / histograms for "spots per band" over the recent window.
- Simple analytics panel ("which band is hottest right now").
- Updates continuously as new spots come in.

8. DX News (RSS Feed)

- Recent DX-related headlines / expedition alerts are fetched from an RSS feed.
- Displayed in a small panel.
- The RSS text color is adapted for dark or light themes to remain legible.

9. Theming and UI

- Two visual directions are supported:
   - Dark ops-style theme (black / dark gray background, green/yellow accents).
   - Light modern theme (pale gray + bluish accents).
- Colors for "watched calls" rows, RSS headlines, etc. are centralized in CSS.
- The idea is: you can restyle the app (dark vs light) without touching the Python logic.

10. Header Status Bar

At the top of the UI:

- Software version (example: "Radio Spot Watcher v2.84 stable").
- Cluster status and hostname:port.
- Total number of spots received.
- Spots received in the last 5 minutes.
- Last update timestamp.
- Band / Mode selectors.
- Watchlist zone.

This acts like a radio operator‚Äôs console dashboard.

üß† Architecture Overview

Backend

- Language: Python 3.11+.
- Framework: Flask.
- The app opens a telnet socket to the DX cluster.
- Each incoming line is parsed using regular expressions.
- Spots are stored in memory using a bounded deque (FIFO with max len).
- Stats (e.g. per band) are computed live.
- The ‚ÄúMost Wanted DXCC‚Äù list is loaded from a small JSON structure; it can be refreshed or modified.
- The backend exposes several JSON endpoints ("/spots.json", "/status.json", "/wanted.json", "/rss.json", etc.) for the front-end to poll.

Frontend

- HTML is assembled in Python and served as one page.
- CSS is embedded (dark or light theme depending on build).
- JavaScript runs in the browser to:
   - poll JSON endpoints,
   - repaint the spots table,
   - refresh the map markers,
   - update charts,
   - manage the watchlist,
   - apply band/mode filters instantly.

Process management

- A helper script "start.sh":
   - Activates the Python venv,
   - Kills any process already using port 8000,
   - Starts the Flask server on "0.0.0.0:8000".
- Reconnect logic is included: if the DX cluster drops, the app tries again automatically.

Storage

- No external database.
- State is primarily in memory.
- A future enhancement is to persist "watchlist", color themes, and cluster preferences to a local JSON file (e.g. "config.json") so they survive restarts.

üõ† Install (Raspberry Pi / Debian)

1. System packages:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip telnet

2. Clone repo:

git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/radio-spot-watcher.git
cd radio-spot-watcher

3. Create & activate venv:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask requests

4. Run:

./start.sh

5. Open in a browser:

   - http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - or http://<your-pi-ip>:8000 on your LAN

üîÑ Cluster fallback
If "dxfun.com:8000" becomes unreachable, the app will attempt to connect to an alternate cluster automatically and reflect that in the header status (still "Connected" if success, otherwise "Offline").

üîß Customization

Callsign for cluster login

Inside the Python code there‚Äôs a "CALLSIGN" (or similar) variable that‚Äôs used when logging into the DX cluster.
Replace it with your personal callsign.

Color accents

Look for the CSS section in the generated HTML:

- ".row-watch" or similar ‚Üí highlight color for watched calls.
- ".rss-item" ‚Üí feed text color.
- Theme vars like "--bg", "--text", etc. control global palette in the light theme build.

Most Wanted DXCC list / flags

The ‚ÄúMost Wanted DXCC‚Äù section is populated from a data structure containing:

- entity label,
- optional DXCC ref,
- target flag / icon,
- display order.
Editing that structure customizes which rare entities are shown first.

üìå Roadmap

Short term:

1. Inline watchlist editor in the header
(text field + [+] button + trash icons per callsign).
2. Restore per-entity flags in the ‚ÄúMost Wanted DXCC‚Äù grid.
3. Improve RSS readability (bright color on dark backgrounds).
4. Allow saving user preferences (theme, watchlist) in a local JSON file.
5. Let the user pick a color palette (dark / light / accent color).

Mid-term:

- Manual cluster selector from UI.
- Band-color legend & toggle on the map.
- Compact layout mode for small screens.

Long-term:

- CSV export of recent spots.
- Distance/range filtering using locators.
- Optional audio/visual alert on watched calls.
